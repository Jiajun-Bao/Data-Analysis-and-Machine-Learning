This project aims to reproduce the music score for the guitar in the 14 seconds clip of the song Sweet Child 
O’ Mine by Guns N’ Roses and reproduce the music score for bass and find guitar solo in 60 seconds clip of the
song Comfortably Numb by Pink Floyd, which are two of the greatest rock and roll songs of all time.
