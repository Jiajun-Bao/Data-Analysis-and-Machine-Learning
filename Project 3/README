This project aims to use the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method to analyze the different
datasets from videos of a spring-mass system recorded from cameras at three different angles. For 
each camera angle, we are provided with four separate cases. One of them is the ideal case, and the
other ones have different variations, such as camera shakes. We will use PCA to compare and contrast
the different instances.
